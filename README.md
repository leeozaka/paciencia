# Patience
This project was a fun experiment to see what I could create using the Windows Console API!!

## Why Patience?
It just seemed like a cool challenge. Also, was a school project to study data structres and algorithms

## How it Works
Play as you would play the game, no big issues here. Even if i didn't know how to play at the time i was got into building this lol

you'll gonna see something like this

## Installation

To get this game up and running, you'll need a Windows machine with a recent version of the Windows Terminal.

    Clone the repository: git clone
    Compile: I've included a handy Makefile to simplify the build process. Just fire up your favorite terminal and run: make

That's it! You should now have a shiny new executable ready to transport you to a world of card-flipping fun, all within the confines of your terminal.
